Current goals for the NFL DB Project are to come up with some metrics for "Big Plays" on possible pass plays

Some ideas are:

- [] Create some sort of Coverage Homology Index (CHI) that can be weighted by player proximity
- [] Identify a run vs. pass topology
  - [] Think of an orientation or speed directed complex
- [] Create some sort of vulnerability score based on these coverage holes.
- [] Separate the defensive field into zones, assign topological scores to defensive configurations. Adapt offense to topological feedback.
